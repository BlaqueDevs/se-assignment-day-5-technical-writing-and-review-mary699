## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Tailoring technical information to the audience's expertise involves adjusting language, depth, examples, format, and tone to ensure it is clear, relevant, and engaging, whether for experts or non-experts.

## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
To tailor content for different audiences, first, understand their expertise level, needs, and preferences.
